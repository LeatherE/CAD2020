Encoder:

use "g++ main.cpp parser.cpp encoder.cpp miter.cpp" to compile

use "./a.out golden_circuit revised_circuit > miter.v" to excute 

compile main.cpp parser.cpp encoder.cpp miter.cpp to ./encoder

compile result_ver2.cpp
after compile use(you must have file called out.txt which was generated by sat solver)
./a.out < cnf.v < miter.v > output
